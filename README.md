Welcome to my hand tracker!

I have created this hand tracker while following the Computer Vision Course provided by freeCodeCamp.org.
I plan on using this hand tracker for future projects, therefore here are my goals for this module:

1. Recognize each hand seperately.
2. Store landmark details to be used in calculations.
3. Create a game that can be played from what I consider to be a bare bones hand tracking module.

I will be adjusting this project for a while. Feel free to use this code 
as you please. I am hoping it will be straightforward to use.
